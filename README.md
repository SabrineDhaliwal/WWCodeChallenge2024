I've registered for 7 days of daily code, focusing on Vanilla JavaScript. I'm going to be working through Wes Bos JavaScript Course. Here's to fun challenges and learning ahead.

    using Wes Bos started code, add & remove event listeners, add & remove classes for transform effects.


Day 2 - CSS & JS Clock
    Using Wes Bos starter code, get date adn set to degrees to emulate a ticking clock.
